title: You Should Listen to Jocko
---
As 2019 nears its close and our Instagram feeds recover from the annual invasion of Spotify Wrapped screenshots, I have begun my reflection on the past 365 days of development in my quest for musical discovery. One of the standout revelations of my year is the Omaha four-piece, Jocko.

Jocko's explosive blend of hardcore punk and hip-hop on their 2018 project *Expression* may be best described as the hardcore Rage Against the Machine tribute band I didn’t know the world needed. With politically charged tracks like *Shades of Green* sonically and lyrically conjuring images of 1990s Zack de la Rocha strutting onstage, and groovy mosh anthems like *River City Stomp* inducing bouts of involuntary laundry room hardcore dancing, this project provides a high momentum tracklist of energetic, compelling hardcore.

In their [interview](https://www.noecho.net/features/jocko) with No Echo, vocalist Jacob Adams describes their musical inspiration.

>"I'd say we draw a lot from '90s hardcore punk and golden-era hip-hop. The originators of the art forms. But we all have such varied taste in music, I know I can say we're all interested in different, obscure, wild styles. If you'd take a road trip with us you'll hear a lot of Leeway and Gang Starr between arguments over Guns N' Roses.”

In the same interview, Adams characterizes their visual approach as striving to be “funky, fresh, and different”, which also succinctly describes what Jocko brings to the table for fans of hip-hop and punk rock.
